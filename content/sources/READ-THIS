These files constitute a pre-release of the B system.
A new, faster system is in preparation, and if you wish to be informed of
the new system's availability, just let us know how you got on with porting
this one.

There are two versions of this B system, a `large' and a `small' version.
The small version fits on a PDP/11 with split I and D spaces, but doesn't
contain the unbounded arithmetic package. The large version needs more code
space than will fit on an 11, but does implement unbounded exact numbers.

The directory `sources' contains the files for both the large and small
B systems.
The special files for the small system are called B???.c and all others
are either common, or for the large system. See Makefile for the definition
of COMMON, BIG and SMALL for the lists.
Actually Bval.c and bval.c are just copies of the same file.

To make a system, use either `make bnew' or `make bsmall'.
For PDP's the makefile needs one change for LDFLAGS.

The directory `doc' contains some documentation:
use nroff -man for b.1, and nroff -ms for on.mark0.
In the directory `test' you will find some small test units.
The directory `lib' contains some shell commands that we use to run B.
