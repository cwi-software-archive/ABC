Overview of the sources.

The B system sources can be divided into two parts, the part implementing B
values, and the interpreter proper.

B Values.
These are dealt with by the following files.

bmem.c	Low level memory management
bval.c	High level memory management for B values, copying, releasing etc
btex.c	Texts
blis.c	Lists
btab.c	Tables
btlt.c	Generic operations on texts, lists and tables
bnu[ACGIQRm].c bfun.c 
	Numbers
bobj.c	Generic operations on all B values (compare etc)

The Interpreter

benv.c	Environments, and the system state
bfil.c	The interface with the file system
bsig.c	Signal and interrupt handling
bscr.c	Output routines, mostly implementing the write command
berr.c	Error message output
bsou.c	Maintaining units and values on external files
bloc.c	The semantics of locations, the put command etc
btyp.c	Type matching tests
bsyn.c	General syntax routines
bexp.c btes.c btar.c
	The syntax and semantics of expressions, tests and targets
bfpr.c	Calling system defined functions and predicates
buni.c	Calling user defined units
bcmd.c	The syntax and semantics of commands
bmai.c	The main program

Most of these have their own header files, but there are also these extra ones:

b.h	Type definitions used throughout the system
bcon.h	Configuration file
bkey.h	B keywords

Most of the machine/operating system dependencies are built into the files
bfil.c, bsig.c, bcon.h.
