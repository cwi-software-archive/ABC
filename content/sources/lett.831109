It didn't compile right away because some of it was too big:

make -k bsmall
bmai.c:23: Symbol table overflow
bsou.c:162: Symbol table overflow
buni.c:30: Symbol table overflow

The rest compiled without problem. I recompiled these three with pcc, and
then it compiled OK.

I think it is a lot faster than the version I had. Some remarks:

1	It crashed (once) when I interrupted it (Oops ... BLURP ...). If it
	goes on doing that I'll send an adb trace.

2	What is the -g option to cc (should be $(CC) by the way) supposed to
	do? I removed it.

3	I haven't got the dirs doc & test. Did I miss much? Is there a
	driver file bin/b, such that bsmall goes to lib/b ? I had one for the
	previous version, but this is different.
